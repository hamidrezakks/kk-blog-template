&lt;p&gt;Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest buzzword on everyone’s lips, but are you as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;conversant with the LTE architecture as you would like to be, or — more importantly —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;need to be? Would you like to find out more about LTE, but have little time to devote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;to it? If so, this paper will help get you up to speed in no time. Originally published as a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;chapter in the most comprehensive LTE reference book available, LTE — The UMTS Long&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Term Evolution: From Theory to Practice (Wiley 2009), this paper provides a short, but&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;comprehensive, overview of the 3GPP Release 8 LTE network architecture and interfaces,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;showing how it can be deployed in an optimized and efficient manner. Engineers involved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in the design of LTE interfaces and network equipment, as well as those involved in the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;first deployments of this new technology, should find this paper invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
